# Task ID: 33
# Title: Modernize Admin Dashboard UI with Design System and Responsive Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 11, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign the admin dashboard UI with a modern design language, implement a responsive, component-based design system, optimize navigation and information architecture, and add dark mode and interactive states.
# Details:
1. Redesign the entire admin interface using a modern UI language (e.g., TailwindCSS v3, Figma-to-code workflows). Define design tokens (color palette, typography scales, spacing, and shadows).
2. Build a unified component library (buttons, forms, modals, tables, cards, alerts) and a living design system documented in Storybook.
3. Implement responsive layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox to support desktop and tablet breakpoints (>=1024px, >=768px).
4. Optimize navigation structure and information architecture: define main sections, sub-sections, and user flows.
5. Develop sidebar navigation with collapsible menus, top navigation bar with user actions, and breadcrumb components to reflect route hierarchy.
6. Design data display screens: responsive tables with sorting/pagination, card-based dashboard widgets, and interactive charts (e.g., using Recharts or Chart.js).
7. Add dark mode support using CSS variables or Tailwind theming; ensure smooth theme switching.
8. Implement interactive states: skeleton loaders for data fetching, spinner and progress indicators, error banners and state views, and form validation feedback.
9. Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, contrast ratios) and cross-browser compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate responsive behavior by testing in browser dev tools at desktop and tablet breakpoints.
2. Use Storybook to test component variations, dark mode, and accessibility checks with axe.
3. Manually verify sidebar, top nav, and breadcrumb navigation across key routes.
4. Simulate loading and error states using network throttling and mock API failures; confirm skeletons and error banners display correctly.
5. Review design tokens against Figma designs for color and typography consistency.
6. Conduct cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
7. Gather UI feedback from stakeholders to ensure improved user experience.

Created an AOSInit.tsx client component with the ‘use client’ directive, a useEffect hook to initialize AOS, an SSR compatibility check (typeof window), and animation settings (duration: 1000ms, once: true, offset: 100px). Installed @types/aos for type definitions. Integrated the AOSInit component into layout.tsx. Added fade-down and fade-up test animations on the homepage. AOS is now fully configured and SSR-compatible.

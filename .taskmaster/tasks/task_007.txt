Ken Burns effect successfully implemented:
- getRandomTransform() generates eight translation combinations (â€“2%, 0, +2% on x/y axes)
- CSS variables --translate-x and --translate-y are set dynamically via style.setProperty on each slide change
- @keyframes random-ken-burns defines a 20-second ease animation starting at scale(1.1) and using CSS variables for panning
- slidechange event listener initializes and recalculates transforms so each image follows a unique movement path

# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Front-End Members Display on About Us Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Fetch and display member data managed in the admin CMS on the public About Us page, including member list, role-based grouping, and individual biographies, fully synchronized with the back-end CRUD and image upload features.
# Details:
1. Create or update the About Us page (e.g., app/about/page.tsx) to fetch member records from Supabase (members table) via the existing CRUD API. Select fields: id, name, role, bio, avatar_url.
2. Use the design system’s card or list components to render each member’s avatar, name, role, and biography. Ensure responsive layout (grid on desktop, list on mobile).
3. Implement role-based filtering or tabs (e.g., “All”, “Developers”, “Designers”) that group members by their role. When a filter is active, display only matching members.
4. Handle loading states (skeleton cards) and error states (friendly error message and retry button).
5. Subscribe to Supabase real-time updates on the members table or re-fetch on page navigation to ensure the front-end display stays in sync with CRUD operations and image uploads.
6. Ensure accessibility: use semantic HTML, ARIA labels for filters, and alt text for avatars.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify initial page load fetches and displays all members sorted by name, showing avatar, role, and bio.
2. Test each role filter/tab: click to filter, confirm only members with that role appear.
3. Perform member add, update, and delete operations in the admin CMS and confirm the About Us page reflects changes on refresh and via real-time updates.
4. Upload or change a member avatar in the admin CMS and verify the updated image appears on the About Us page.
5. Simulate loading (slow network) and server error states to confirm skeletons and error UI appear as expected.
6. Check responsive layout at multiple breakpoints and run basic accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels).

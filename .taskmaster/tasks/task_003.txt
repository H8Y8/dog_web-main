Now that the RootLayout structure is in place, implement responsive design optimizations and testing:

• Define and apply TailwindCSS breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl) across Navbar, main content and Footer  
• Adjust Navbar menu behavior and layout for mobile (≤640px), tablet (≤768px) and desktop screens  
• Collapse Footer’s three-column layout into a stacked layout on small viewports and ensure consistent spacing  
• Ensure the main content area flexibly resizes with appropriate padding and margins at each breakpoint  
• Test the complete layout on key viewports (e.g. 320px, 768px, 1440px) using both browser dev tools and physical devices  
• Verify no unexpected layout shifts, maintain SEO metadata/Open Graph tag integrity, and confirm smooth navigation across screen sizes

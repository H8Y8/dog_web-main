## 1. Image Optimization Techniques Research [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research various techniques for optimizing images, including compression, format selection, and responsive images.
### Details:
Focus on lossless and lossy compression methods, image formats like WebP and JPEG, and how to implement responsive images using srcset.

## 2. Implement Image Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Apply the researched image optimization techniques to the project images.
### Details:
Use tools like ImageMagick or online services to compress images, convert formats, and implement responsive images in the codebase.

## 3. Code Splitting Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Implement code splitting in the project to improve loading times and performance.
### Details:
Utilize dynamic imports and configure the build tool (like Webpack) to split the code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand.

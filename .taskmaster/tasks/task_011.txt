# Task ID: 11
# Title: Setup Supabase Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Supabase for database, authentication, and storage functionalities, including database schema creation (posts, members, puppies, environments), Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, and four storage buckets as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Install the Supabase client using `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`. Configure Supabase in the application: set up authentication, define the database schema with tables for posts, members, puppies, and environments, enable RLS with basic policies, and configure storage services with four buckets per PRD requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Run smoke tests to validate the Supabase connection; verify authentication flows including JWT token issuance and validation; confirm that the database schema tables exist and RLS policies enforce access controls correctly; test file uploads/downloads in all four storage buckets.

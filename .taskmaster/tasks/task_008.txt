# Task ID: 8
# Title: Migrate ScrollText Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate the ScrollText component and replace React Scroll functionality with native scrolling.
# Details:
Remove the React Scroll dependency and implement scrolling using `scrollIntoView` or `window.scrollTo`. Add the 'use client' directive to the ScrollText component.

# Test Strategy:
Test that the scrolling functionality works as expected and that all animations are intact.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current React Scroll Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing React Scroll functionality to understand how it is integrated and identify the key features that need to be replicated with native scrolling methods.
### Details:
Focus on the components and methods used for scrolling, including any props or state management related to scroll behavior.

ScrollText component already uses native scroll APIs without any React Scroll dependency. It features:
1. native scroll event listeners
2. complex scroll-based calculation logic
3. responsive spacing adjustments for mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. interactive path and dog animation
5. dynamic opacity and scale effects

Migration steps:
– add 'use client' directive at the top of the component file  
– update imports and hooks to comply with Next.js client component requirements  
– verify native scroll listener binding and cleanup in the Next.js rendering lifecycle  
– ensure responsive breakpoints and all animations/effects continue to work under the new setup

## 2. Implement Native Scrolling Methods [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Replace the identified React Scroll functionality with native scrolling methods, ensuring that all features are preserved and performance is optimized.
### Details:
Utilize native JavaScript methods such as scrollTo and scrollIntoView, and ensure compatibility across different browsers.

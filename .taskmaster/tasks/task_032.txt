# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Supabase Auth
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Completed integration of Supabase authentication for user login, session management, and admin role management in the CMS.
# Details:
• lib/auth.ts: login/logout, session management, admin permission checks, admin user creation
• lib/hooks/useAuth.ts: React hook for auth logic, auto state handling, helper functions
• app/admin/page.tsx: real Supabase auth, admin permission enforcement, loading and error states, email login
• lib/admin-setup.ts: development‐mode quick setup, custom admin creation, error handling
• app/admin/setup/page.tsx: visual UI for admin creation, quick and custom setup flows, user feedback
• Security: JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies, permission checks, robust error handling
• Usage: 1) Visit /admin/setup to create an admin user; 2) Visit /admin to log in; 3) Default test account: admin@example.com / admin123456

# Test Strategy:
Verify full authentication flows: login, logout, session persistence, admin setup UI, role‐based access control, error handling, and JWT cookie security.
